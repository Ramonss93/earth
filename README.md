google earth engine scripts by Douglas Franz

Google Earth Engine is a free resource (for non-commericial use) that allows 
users to write custom Javascript programs to manipulate huge amount of geospatial 
(satellite, etc.) data to create unique and useful visualizations.

I'm collecting my own scripts here.
